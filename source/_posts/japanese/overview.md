<!-- I started learning Japanese on 26th Dec 2019. This post is to summarise some of my learnings and useful tips for new learners. -->

Notice: this guide is from a Chinese & English speaker perspective, so the resources/experiences may not apply to everyone.

## 五十音/Gojūon

Many people says that the only way to learn Hiragana and Katagana is through rote learning. I didn't know that when I started learning so I learnt with assistance of several apps :P.

- [50音起源](http://kanaorigin.producter.io/) is an app to learn Hiragana and Katakana by etymology.
- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com): Many people have used this app. I have been using this app to learn German before.

## Grammar

### Declarative

* DECLARATIVE →
  + (はい、)(NOUN は) NOUN です。 |
    A is B.
  - (いいえ、)(NOUN では) NOUN ありません。 |
    A is not B.
  - {% ruby 違|ちが %}います。
    That is remotely different.


Note: は is pronounced as わ in speaking. See [particles](#Particles). 

### Interrogative
INTERROGATIVE → DECLARATIVE か。

Is ... true?

The か can be omitted in speaking. In that case a rising tone at the end is needed.
